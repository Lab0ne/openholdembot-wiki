# If you want to buy...

... we don’t sell anything.

However if you really need “more” than you get here, especially built-in
support for some pokersites, a winning bot for the lowest microstakes
(NL 2 – yes, that are blinds of \$0.01/\$0.02) and professional
hand-holding, then you might want to consider buying the original
Shanky-bot at
<a href="www.bonusbots.com" class="uri">www.bonusbots.com</a>. To our
best knowledge they offer an advertisement-deal of \$30 or \$50 or
something for every customer who gets referred. However: we do neither
want to nor need to make any money advertising such funny things like
“winning poker-bots”, but we don’t want to waste that money either. So
if you really buy their bot, please register to their forum, send
greetings to everybody and ask Egor to send that money to
