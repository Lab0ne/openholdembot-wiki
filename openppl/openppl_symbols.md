# OpenPPL Symbols

Below you find a list of OpenPPL symbols. They are part of the OpenPPL
function-library, which gets loaded automatically when you load
OpenHoldem. Most of these symbols work exactly the same way as their PPL
counterparts. Only very few differ, mostly for technical reasons, but
some of them because we think it is better that way. These differences
are documented of course. You will also find some new symbols, that are
not part of standard PPL; some PokerTracker and stacksize symbols for
example. However: we didn’t implement everything that is possible and
desireable. More extensions are subject of the next chapter: “Building
Symbols On Your Own”. Who knows: if you come up with some good code,
reasonable naming and a good description your new symbols might become
part of a future OpenPPL-release.

**Please note that all oPPL symbols are case sensitive**
