# What Is OpenPPL

PPL is an acronym for *Poker Programming Language*, a language to
program poker bots. It was invented by [Shanky
BonusBots](http://www.bonusbots.com) to ease the customization of their
proprietary bot-logic.

One day an unnamed hero decided to give away his “80% working
translator” to the OpenHoldem community. So OpenPPL was born and after a
long period of development OpenPPL finally got completely integrated
into OpenHoldem. Whereas the first version of OpenPPL needed to be
translated to OH-script, OpenHoldem does now natively support plain-text
OpenPPL without any translation steps. So OpenPPL now combines the best
of both worlds even better: easiness of programming and mighty potential
at the tables.

## The Advantage Of OpenPPL

Of course OpenPPL supports the main features of PPL, especially:

- an easy English-like programming language, that can be learned in no
  time.

- a library of several hundred ready-to-use functions for an easy start.

Besides that OpenHoldem & OpenPPL provide some additional cool
functionality that you might have missed if you have used other bots in
the past:

- knowing the stacksize of every single player.

- the ability to play at any casino you want, provided you create a
  tablemap for it.

- the ability to develop and debug your bot with tools like ManualMode,
  PokerAcademy and PokerTH. Did you ever want to simulate A2o at the
  button or a flushdraw out of position several dozen times until you
  are satisfied?

- an auto-connector, that handles up to 25 tables at once with less than
  1% CPU-overhead. All you have to do: open a table and sit-down.
  OpenHoldem connects automatically (one instance per table) and starts
  to play.

- ability to use Poker Tracker stats directly in your OpenPPL-code.

But if you are an expert you might want to make use of some advanced
features:

- building symbols on your own.

- accessing Openholdem’s native symbols and doing hand-range
  calculations on the fly.

And the best of all:

- you can contribute to the project to make it even better.

- it’s all for free. Well – nearly free; of course it requires a bit of
  learning and some work to become a master.

*Welcome to the world of open source!*
