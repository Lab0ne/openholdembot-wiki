# Contributing to the Manual

This document is based on the manual for OpenHoldem, lots of
former Wiki-entries and lots of forum-posts at
<http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/>. Many people contributed to it,
but as you can see this manual is neither complete nor perfect. Lets
blame the people who put it together for everything ;-)

If you have some corrections or additions and want to help us to improve
this manual then feel welcome to get in contact with the development
team or make a pull request to <https://github.com/Lab0ne/openholdem-wiki>.
