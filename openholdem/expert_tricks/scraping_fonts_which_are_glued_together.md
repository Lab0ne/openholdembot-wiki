# Scraping fonts which are glued together

This chapter is about font creation, precisely about the main difficulty
that can happen: sometime two or more characters seem to touch each
other, they are printed without any visible distance. This can cause
problems because the scraper tries to recognize one character after
another, but out of the box it can’t handle groups of characters that
look like something unknown.

At the first picture below you see the good case: OpenScrape tries to
recognize the playername “platinum333” and the first character “p” gets
properly separated from the rest. All we have to do here: tell
OpenScrape that this group of pixels is a “p”.

The second character “l” works also properly, but the next two
characters are glued together: they can’t be separated by a vertical
empty line of pixels. OpenScrape would like to know what “at” means in
the alphabet..

Unfortunatelly “at” is no proper character, but there is a little trick
to separate these two characters. We temporary make the boundaries of
the name-region smaller so that it only contains the first of these two
characters – the “a”. Then OpenScrape will try to recognize all
characters in this small region, which contains only the pixels of “a”.
Now we can define “a” just like any other normal font.

We repeat this process for the second critical character “t”. Then both
of them can be recognized individually.

Once this got done we can restore the original region. The first 4
characters get now recognized properly and we can continue with the
rest.
