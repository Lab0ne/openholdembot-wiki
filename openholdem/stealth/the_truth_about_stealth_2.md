# The Truth about Stealth

but consider the following points:

- stealth is a very delicate topic. Nobody wants to talk about it on a
  public forum at the internet, where any employee of a poker-site can
  read. You are probably a nice guy like 99% of all other people here,
  but at the moment you are just an unknown stranger. (I hope, this will
  change over time.)

- perfect stealth without a winning bot is worth nothing. But a winning
  bot without stealth (or with standard stealth) is worth a fortune, as
  most sites don’t really care.

- botting is a very complex hobby. It involves many different topics,
  such as bot-logic, opponent-modelling, table-maps, hoppers, stealth
  and some more. Everyone of them could take some months to master.

- 99% of all botter reach never the point of profitability. A losing bot
  doesn’t need much stealth at all (if any) and people who will
  disappear in a few weeks don’t need to know the deepest secrets of the
  veterans (at least IMO).

- and even if we told you: how could you master perfect stealth without
  having mastered the basics?

So why not get rid of some complexity? IMO the way to success looks like
that

- create a basic bot, that plays something that looks like poker.
  ManualMode and PokerAcademy are great ways to develop your first basic
  bot offline, without having to care about stealth, hoppers and table
  maps at all (honestly: the TM for PA might need some tweaking, but
  that’s it).

- once you have a basic bot, fix or create a tablemap and start playing
  real opponents at a site, that doesn’t care. Your first version will
  have some bugs and maybe simplified strategy. It won’t win you any
  money and you shouldn’t use a real account for that bot (just in
  case). Register as Mickey Mouse, Mouseton, take a paysafe-card and
  cash some money in and start playing and improving.

- once you have a winning bot at a meaningful samplesize you can start
  creating a farm. You still should choose a site that doesn’t care, but
  now you should care about stealth (at least a bit). Now it is time to
  learn about standard stealth and setup a clean system.

- even when you have managed to create a profitable bot, you should
  still forget about sites like PokerStars, PartyPoker and FullTilt in
  the early stages of building a bot-farm. These sites do care (some a
  bit more, some a bit less) and they will bust beginners (you still are
  a beginner stealth-wise). But the other poker sites provide enough
  traffic in the microstakes and low-stakes to keep you busy for some
  time and to master the basics of stealth.

- once you have reached that point you will be a forum-veteran and a
  honourable poker-botter. Then Max will invite you to a beer to
  Montreal and you will be welcome to ask any question you like.
