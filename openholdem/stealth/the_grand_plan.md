# The Grand Plan

So you want to start real money botting? Knowing your worst enemy you
can plan a practical stealth setup and avoid all unnecessary complexity.
In our opinion the way to success looks like that

- Create a basic bot, that plays something that looks like poker.
  ManualMode, DDPoker, PokerTH and PokerAcademy are great ways to
  develop your first basic bot offline, without having to care about
  stealth, hoppers and table maps at all (honestly: the TM for PA might
  need some tweaking, but that’s it).

- Once you have created a basic bot, fix or create a tablemap and start
  playing real opponents at a site, that does not care. Your first
  version will have some bugs and maybe simplified strategy. It won’t
  win you any money and you shouldn’t use a real account for that bot
  (just in case). Register as Mickey Mouse, Mouseton, take a
  paysafe-card and cash some money in and start playing and improving.

- Once you have a winning bot at a meaningful samplesize you can start
  creating a farm. You still should choose a site that doesn’t care, but
  now you should care about stealth (at least a bit). Now it is time to
  learn about standard stealth and setup a clean system.

- Even when you have managed to create a profitable bot, you should
  still forget about sites like PokerStars, PartyPoker and FullTilt in
  the early stages of building a bot-farm. These sites do care (some a
  bit more, some a bit less) and they will bust beginners (you still are
  a beginner stealth-wise). But the other poker sites provide enough
  traffic in the microstakes and low-stakes to keep you busy for some
  time and to master the basics of stealth.

- Once you have reached that point you will be a forum-veteran and a
  honourable poker-botter. Then Max will invite you to a beer to
  Montreal and you will be welcome to ask any question you like.

## FAQ

*How do I cash out the money from the Mickey-Mouse-account?*

Forget about it!

This test-account will lose. Once your bot wins you still need an
account to test future improvements and you don’t want to risk your real
accounts just because of 50 bucks. Always remember: *Most people fail
for stupidity and greed.*
