# Ini-Files and Registry 

By default OpenHoldem will store its preferences, settings and the list
of last recenttly used files an Ini-Files to avoid any fingerprints in
the registry.

    OpenHoldem_Preferences__feel_free_to_rename_this_file_to_whatever_you_like.INI

The filename says everything: you can name this file however you want as
long as there is only one such ini-file in the OpenHoldem directory.
However: other applications such as OpenScrape still use the registry.
So if you have installed other applications of the OpenHoldem
product-suite on your casino-machine you might want to read the Chapter
about uninstallation.
