# Rootkits

Rootkits are generally considered to be the subject of viruses, malware
and other anti-social computer topics
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit>). In the case of poker botting,
however, we can use rootkits to our advantage. Specifically, since
rootkits can hide such things as viruses, they can also hide OpenHoldem
programs, registry entries, network ports (Bring traffic), files, etc.

This document will not give you specific steps for configuring and using
a rootkit. That is up to you. However, a Google of “hacker defender” may
or may not turn up some interesting results.

* 1*. Your anti-virus software will go nuts if you try to run a rootkit
while your anti-virus software is operating. If you can configure your
anti-virus software with a white list, then this may help the situation.
Otherwise, you may need to uninstall your anti-virus software to use a
rootkit.
