# Stealth

An important consideration for any botter is that of stealth. Many
casinos will attempt to detect the OpenHoldem software on your computer
and will either warn you or seize your account’s funds if they find it.
There are two general approaches to addressing this problem, a *Single
System* solution and a *Dual System* solution. OpenHoldem provides a
number of facilities for achieving both of these setups and obscuring
the program from detection.

Note that a “System” as discussed in this chapter can refer to a
physical machine or a virtual machine. VMware Workstation is a popular
choice for consumer system virtualization, but certainly you can make
use of the other consumer virtualization products available, such as
VirutalPC or VirtualBox. Addtionally, data center-class, bare metal
hypervisor products such as VMWare ESX or Citrix XEN will work fine as
well. See the VMWare section for information on configuring VMWare
Workstation. Configuration of other virtualization platforms is not
discussed in this documentation.
