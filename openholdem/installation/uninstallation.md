# Uninstallation

We hope you will never have to uninstall OpenHoldem on any of your
machines. However, we often see enthusiastic newbies who download
OpenHoldem and naively install it to their one and only machine without
any attempts to stealth it. And then they ask how they can get their
computer clean again – be it that they failed and want to play manually
again or they want to create a clean setup for production.

Probably it is too late – you have already been flagged by your
favourite casino. Anyway – the “best” way to get your PC “clean” again
without a reinstallation:

- Remove the complete installation directory and all other
  botting-related files you may have on your computer: executables,
  formulae, tablemaps, archives, logs, etc.

- Delete any desktop icons and delete any startmenu shortcut (if you
  have created them) .

- OpenHoldem (version 4.x+) no longer uses the registry to store its
  preferences. However Windows stores some information like last
  recently used files. Take a registry-editor like regedit.exe and
  search for “openholdem”, “openscrape”, “manualmode”, “.ohf”, “.oppl”,
  “.tm”, “maxinmontreal” and maybe some others.

- Wipe your browser cache.
