# Pokerval explained

OpenHoldem classifies and orders poker hands into a single 32bit value.

## Bits 31-24 indicate the hand rank 

- Straight flush = bit 31 set

- Four of a kind = bit 30 set

- Full house = bit 29 set

- Flush = bit 28 set

- Straight = bit 27 set

- Three of a kind = bit 26 set

- Two pair = bit 25 set

- One pair = bit 24 set

- 5-of-a-kind is indicated when bits 31-24 are set to 1

- High-card (no pair) is indicated when bits 31-24 are set to 0

## Bits 23-20 are not used

- Bits 19-16 indicate the rank of the top card in the hand

- Bits 15-12 indicate the rank of the second card in the hand

- Bits 11-8 indicate the rank of the third card in the hand

- Bits 7-4 indicate the rank of the fourth card in the hand

- Bits 3-0 indicate the rank of the fifth card in the hand

## Numeric values for the ranks (bits 19-1) are: 

- 14 Ace

- 13 King

- 12 Queen

- 11 Jack

- 10-2 Ten-Two

- 1 Ace (in lo straight)

## Pokerval comparisons

The pokerval symbol maps every 0 to 7 card poker hand onto the 32bit
number space in correct order of game precedence, allowing two poker
hands can be compared to see which is the better hand - higher values
are better. The lowest possible value is 0 (no cards).

Now we either apply a binary operation or we feed the pokerval into
MicroSofts calculator and then switch to binary mode:

Not that hard to interpret the result.

## Player/Pocket Card List 

The symbol pcbits is a bit list that indicates where your dealt pocket
cards are used in your 5 card poker hand. Ony the lower order 5 bits are
significant - one bit per card in your 5 card poker hand. Each bit
corresponds to a pokerval rank field as follows:

bit# pokerval bit4 rank5 bit3 rank4 bit2 rank3 bit1 rank2 bit0 rank1.

In the example above pcbits would look like

    pcbits = 00110

because we contribute 7 and 6 in a 98765-straight.

If all bits in pcbits are zero then neither of your two cards are used
in your 5 card hand. The following formula fragment will be true if you
have a sucker straight:

    ((nstraight==5) && (pcbits==1))

The following formula fragment will be true if you are filling an inside
straight:

    ((nstraight==5) && (pcbits&14))

The formula symbol npcbits contains the number of your pocket cards
being used in your 5 card poker hand. The possible values are: 0, 1 and
2.
