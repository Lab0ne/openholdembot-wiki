# Handstrength-library

In the legendary golden age of Fixed Limit Hold’em Winngy, member of Lab
1, developed a hand-strength-library that rates all hands from 1 (weak)
to 5 (very strong). He used it successfully in his private
Fixed-Limit-bot that played \$5/\$10 at that time. For the No-Limit-guys
of modern times: these were the blinds, not buyins; and he also got a
100%-prop-deal to make his hobby even more enjoyable. Long story short:
Fixed Limit died slowly and so Winngy decided to donate his
hand-ranking-system to the OpenHoldem project. Our member HTC added his
outs-counter. Both are combined in a library, which can be downloaded
from
<https://github.com/Lab0ne/openholdembot/blob/master/mh_str_Handstrength_Library/mh_str_Handstrength_Library.ohf>.To
make use of these functions just include this library in your bot-logic.
