# Iterations and Standard Deviation

Running AA headsup preflop with X iterations in OpenHoldem to determine
the standard deviation in prwin for the various numbers of iterations.
Here are the results:

Here is how to use the data in the above graphs:

1.  Decide what error you find acceptable 99% of the time. For example,
    if you are happy with getting prwinâ€™s of 0.846 - 0.852 99% of the
    time for AA headsup preflop, your error would be (0.849) +- 0.003.

2.  That error is standard deviations. To get 1 standard deviation,
    divide by 3 (to give std. dev. = 0.001).

3.  Find that standard deviation in the top chart and read off the
    number of iterations required. In our case, it would be 100,000
    required iterations.

The prwin values you obtain will be within 1 standard deviation 67% of
the time, within 2 standard deviations 95% of the time, and within 3
standard deviations 99% of the time.
