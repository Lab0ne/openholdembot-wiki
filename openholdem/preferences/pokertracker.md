- *Host Name / IP Address, Port, Username, Password, DB Name*: These are
  the parameters that you entered when you setup your Poker Tracker
  PostgreSQL database. Enter them here so OpenHoldem knows how to
  connect to your database. If you do not understand what these settings
  mean, please refer to the Poker Tracker homepage
  (<http://www.pokertracker.com>) for more information.

- *Test*: This button will test the connection to the Poker Tracker
  database as specified by the above parameters and will report success
  or failure codes. Help with connecting to PostgreSQL databases can be
  found here: http://www.pokertracker.com, or here:
