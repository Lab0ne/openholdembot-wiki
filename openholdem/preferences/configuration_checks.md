# Configuration Checks

OpenHoldem will check some parts of your system configuration
automatically on start-up to avoid the most common and time-consuming
mis-configurations. Some of them (like minimum colour-depth) will always
be executed, other can be turned off, if you don’t use certain features.

- *Check Keyboard Settings:* this option will, check for an english
  keyboard layout. Keyboard settings affect especially the decimal point
  in numbers and therefore the scraper-engine and the auto-player. If
  you continue with incorrect settings, OpenHoldem may or may not work
  as expected. If you are an experienced user with a working setup you
  may turn this warning off, but if you encounter problems (especially
  with betsizing) or are a beginner, you should better get your keyboard
  layout configured the correct way.

- *Check Window Theme Settings:* this option will check, if the windows
  theme is set to Windows Classic (Windows 2000 style), as that is the
  recommended theme and many TableMaps are build using this
  configuration. If you know exactly, what you do and are able to adapt
  your TableMaps to other configurations, then you may turn this setting
  off. However — be aware, that any fancy settings might possibly break
  the scraper and will reduce your possibility to exchange maps with
  other users.

- *Check Font Smoothing Settings:* This option will check, if Font
  Smoothing is turned off, as recommended. Font Smoothing does display
  names and numbers slightly more eye-freindly for a human user, but it
  will render scraping more difficult. If you know exactly what you do
  you may again turn this option off.

## Other Configuration Checks

OpenHoldem does execute various other configuration checks, but part of
them can’t be turned off, as they are mandatory settings and the other
ones will be triggered automatically.

### Mandatory checks

- Mimimum colour depth of 24 bits.
