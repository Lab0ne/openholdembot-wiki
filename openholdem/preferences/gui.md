# OpenHoldem Preferences – GUI

GUI preferences control how the OpenHoldem GUI operates on startup.

- *Start minimized:* This option will cause OpenHoldem to start in
  minimzed mode. It is especially useful, if you have to start new bots
  during a session and don’t want to accept the risk of occluding tables
  and causing misscrapes.

- *Disable all runtime MessageBoxes*: This preference will prevent
  OpenHoldem from displaying warning and error message boxes during
  runtime (when OpenHoldem is connected to a table). This is
  extraordinarily dangerous and should only be used when you have a 100%
  stable bot that you want to move to a fully automated execution model.
  It is strongly advised that you do not check this option until you
  have a very stable and thoroughly tested botting environment.
  Interactive messages on user-interaction are not affected by this
  option.
