# Scout - A Hopper

Hopper is the name generally given to AutoIt scripts that automatically
start and connect poker windows for you. One of the formerly best (and
most complex) hoppers is Scout, that is open-source just like
OpenHoldem. It is availabe at
<http://scout-poker-bot-hopper.googlecode.com/files/Scout2.68.zip>.

Scout will not work out of the box, guaranteed, and it implements a bit
“too much” functionality for modern OpenHoldem 7.x, but it can serve as
a possible starting point for your script for your casino. This is an
important point hoppers, like Table Maps, are very specific to a given
casino. Think about the actions you take to join a table on different
casinos the actions to do that all differ ever so slightly!
