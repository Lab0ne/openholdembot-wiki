Alright, so you have made it through the previous sections, and have a
working Table Map, a set of bot logic for your target game, and a
fully-stealthed out configuration. You may have just started to realize
what a pain it is to have to manually start the software, start the
casino, choose a table, sit at the table, leave the table, start a new
table, etc. This becomes even more oppressive if you want to run
multiple simultaneous tables.

The answer is automation. Automation will do these opening, selecting,
moving, and clicking activities for you, and allow you to ultimately
sleep while your poker bot plays for you. Nothing better than making
money while you sleep!
