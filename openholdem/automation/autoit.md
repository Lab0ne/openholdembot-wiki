AutoIt is a free (as in beer – this is not an open source program)
Windows scripting language and execution engine. From the web site
(introduction part: <http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/index.shtml>):

> “AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for
> automating the Windows GUI and general scripting. It uses a
> combination of simulated keystrokes, mouse movement and window/control
> manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or
> reliable with other languages (e.g. VBScript and SendKeys). AutoIt is
> also very small, self-contained and will run on all versions of
> Windows out-of-the-box with no annoying runtimes required! AutoIt was
> initially designed for PC roll out situations to reliably automate and
> configure thousands of PCs. Over time it has become a powerful
> language that supports complex expressions, user functions, loops and
> everything else that veteran scripters would expect....AutoIt is a
> freeware Windows automation language. It can be used to script most
> simple Windows-based tasks... AutoIt has been in popular use since
> 1999 and continues to provide users and administrators with an easy
> way to script the Windows GUI. In February 2004 the latest version of
> AutoIt - known as AutoIt v3 - was released and added powerful
> scripting features.”

Automation of poker botting is one of those “simple Windows-based tasks”
that AutoIt is great for. The challenge is that now you have a new
language to learn (does it ever end?), but the support for AutoIt on
their forums is astounding, and you can also get help on the OpenHoldem
forums.
