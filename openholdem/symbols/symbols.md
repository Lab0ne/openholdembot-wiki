# Built-in Symbols

This section is largely based on the information originally written by
Ray Bornert (<http://www.winholdem.net/help/help-formula.html#symbols>)
and extended to include OpenHoldem-specific symbols.

These symbols take output from the scraper engine, from Table Map
parameters, and from your formula functions to derive various bits of
data that are useful when instructing the OpenHoldem Autoplayer how to
act. The set of symbols got extended over time – not all of them are
available for all versions of OpenHoldem. This list reflects the state
of the latest version. Some old WinHoldem symbols got never implemented
due to lack of documentation and practical relevance. Others got
replaced or removed over time. Please refer to the chapter “Outdated
Features and Incompatibilities between OpenHoldem and WinHoldem” for
more information.

As you already might have noticed some of these symbols are of rather
technical nature, A set of several hundred more poker-logical symbols is
included in the OpenPPL-library that gets discussed in the seeparate
OpenPPL-manual. Both languages can be mixed in nearly any way however,
so please read on. Here you will find some valuable symbols that you
might be miss in OpenPPL.

## General

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| session | the current logging instance (0-24) |
| version | returns the version number of OpenHoldem that is currently running |

## Tournament Info

MTT symbols provide you some info about the tournament you currently
play. They are most useful forswcisions at the bubble. Each one of these
symbols returns the value of the corresponding tablemap-region (e.g.
r\$mtt_number_entrants, etc.). To make use of these symbols they must be
displayed at the table, so that OpenHoldem can scrape them.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| mtt_number_entrants | Number of players participating in the tournament |
| mtt_players_remaining | Number of players still alive in the tournament |
| mtt_paid_places | Number of paid places, useful for decisions at the bubble |
| mtt_my_rank | My current place in the tournament depending on stacksize, assuming that all players with smaller stacks bust before me |
| mtt_largest_stack k | Stacksize of the chip-leader, usually in dollars |
| mtt_average_stack | Average stacksize of all tournament plazers, usually in dollars |
| mtt_smallest_stack | Smallest stack in the tournament, usually in dollars |

## Hand Rank 

Handrank rates your hand-value, assuming you go preflop allin against N
opponents, who hold random cards (N = f\$prwin_number_of_opponents). A
low handrank means. your hand is good, a high handrank means, that many
holdings are a favourit against you. For more info see the chapter about
handrank.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| handrank169 | your pocket holdem hand rank 1-169 |
| handrank2652 | your pocket holdem hand rank 12-2652 |
| handrank1326 | your pocket holdem hand rank 6-1326 (handrank2652/2) |
| handrank1000 | your pocket holdem hand rank 4-1000 (1000\*handrank2652/2652) |
| handrankp | 2652 / (1+f\$prwin_number_of_opponents) |

## Chairs 

Please note OpenHoldem needs to see player-cards in a
non-showdown-situation to recognize the userchair and then will lock the
chair for stability reasons until the session of the hand. A change in
userchair can happen on table-change in MTTs at some casinos and will be
handled automatically.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| userchair | user cha$$ir number (0-9), 0 is usually top right |
| headsupchair | chair number of the one and only opponent headsup (0-9) |
| bigblindchair | big blind chair number(0 - 9) |
| smallblindchair | small blind chair number (0-9) |
| dealerchair | dealer chair number (0-9) |
| cutoffchair | cut off chair number (0-9) |
| mp3chair | middle position 3 chair number (0-9) |
| mp2chair | middle position 2 chair number (0-9) |
| mp1chair | middle position 1 chair number (0-9) |
| ep3chair | early position 3 chair number (0-9) |
| ep2chair | early position 2 chair number (0-9) |
| ep1chair | early position 1 chair number (0-9) |
| utgchair | under the gun chair number (0-9) |
| firstcallerchair | the chair of the first caller in front of you (0-9), current orbit only |
| lastcallerchair | the chair of the last caller in front of you (0-9), current orbit only |
| firstraiserchair | the chair of the first raiser in front of you (0-9), current orbit only |
| lastraiserchair | the chair of the last raiser in front of you (0-9), current orbit only |
| raischair | synonym for lastraiserchair |
| bigstackchair | the chair of the playing opponent with the biggest stack (0-9) |
| smallstackchair | the chair of the playing opponent with the smallest stack (0-9) |
| chair\$abc | player “abc” chair number (0-9); -1 if not found, case-sensitive |
| chairbit\$abc | player “abc” chairbit (1 \<\< chair\$abc); 0 if not found, case-sensitive |

## Positions

To avoid problems with fast folds in early position the
dealposition-symbols will consider the following players as dealt

- any players who are betting, especially the blinds

- all active players between the blinds and the first user who holds
  cards, i.e. players who are seated and not sitting out. If one of
  these players does not hold cards, then OpenHoldem will assume that it
  is due to very fast folds in early positions.

- the user, if he is seated and holds cards

- any players with cardbacks, especially all players between the user
  and the dealer.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| betround | betting round (1-4) 1=preflop, 2=flop, 3=turn, 4=river |
| currentround | synonym for betround |
| previousround | the previous betting round (1-3, 1 if the current round is preflop) |
| preflop | verbose constant for the 1st betting round |
| flop | verbose constant for the 2nd betting round |
| turn | verbose constant for the 3rd betting round |
| river | verbose constant for the 4th betting round |
| betposition | your bet position (1=left to the dealer=usually sblind, 2=bblind, ..., nplayersdealt=dealer); contrary to dealposition betposition will change as players fold in front of you. |
| dealposition | your deal position 1 = left to the dealer, usually small blind2 = 2 left to the dealer, usually big blind ... nplayersdealt = dealer. dealposition will not change as players fold. Dealposition does not magically auto-adapt for special cases like a missing small-blind. If you want to figure out chairs better use the more modern chair symbols. |
| callposition | your numbered offset from the raising player (who is 0) |
| dealpositionrais | the deal position of the raising player (1-10) |
| betpositionrais | the bet position of the raising player (1-10) |

## Probabilities 

There are several variations of PrWin (standard, weighted and enhanced),
each with several pros and cons. For more info see the chapter about
PrWin.

| \$\$CCc | references a card symbol - see the *Card Symbol*s section below for details |
| ishandup | true if your hand has gone up a level (i.e. from 1 pair to 2 pair) |
| ishandupcommon | true if common hand has gone up a level (i.e. from 1 pair to 2 pair) |
| ishicard | true when you have hicard hand |

## Hand and Board-Expressions

| hand\$XYZ | true, if your hand contains XYZ. The expression may contain 1 or 2 cards, optionally concrete suits or optionally the postfix “Suited”. |
|:---|:---|
| board\$XYZ | true, The expression may contain 1 up to 5 cards, optionally concrete suits or optionally the postfix “Suited”. |

Hand and board expressions got implemented for OpenPPL, but of course
they can be also used for OH-script. Especially board-expressions are in
most cases more intuitive than rankbits(common). Some examples for hand
and board-expressions (OpenPPL)

    WHEN hand$AA RaiseMax FORCE
    WHEN hand$AKSuited RaisePot FORCE
    // We love playing hearts...
    WHEN hand$Ah Call FORCE
    // ...but fear the devil
    WHEN board$666 Fold FORCE

| ispair      | true when your two dealt pocket cards are rank equal (0-1)    |
| issuited    | true when your two dealt pocket cards are suit equal (0-1)    |

Note that “raising players” does no longer count the so-called
“blind-raisers” (former WinHoldem definition).

## Flags 

| Symbol   | Meaning                                                     |

The flags toolbar is used to set internal OpenHoldem flag symbols
f0..f19 to on or off. These flags can be used in your formula set to
quickly enanble or disable certain functionality. E.g. you could use
flag 0 to to tell your bot to use a different starting-hands-chart or to
do more conti-betting.

## Common Cards 

| Symbol            | Meaning                                               |
|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| ncommoncardsknown | number of common cards known (normal not highlighted) |

## (Un)known Cards

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| ncardsknown | total number of cards you can see (yours and commons) |
| ncardsunknown | total number of cards you cannot see (deck and opponents) |
| ncardsbetter | total number of single unknown cards that can beat you, e.g. if the board is four suited in hearts, and you have two spades, then ncardsbetter will be at least 9, because of the possible flush |
| nouts | the total number of unseen single cards that if dealt to the board might put your hand in the lead. to be counted as an out, the card must be able to bump your level and your new level must be higher than the resulting common level. |

<div class="rem">

* 1.4*. Ray E. Bornerts definition of an out is way too optimistic and
nearly unusable (a hand like 72o at a board of AKQ will give you 6 outs,
as every 7 and every 2 will bump your handlevel to a pair, which beats
high-card ace at the board). To calculate outs in a meaningful way,
there is f\$mh_nouts in Winngys and HTCs hand-strength-library and there
are also some good outs-counters available in the forum. However we had
to keep this symbol in the code-base, as some outs-counters are based on
nouts and try to discount it in a meanigful way.

</div>

## nhands

| nranked | total number of same ranked cards you have (1-4) |
| nrankedcommon | total number of same ranked cards in the middle (1-4) |
| trank | specific card rank for nranked (2-14) |
| trankcommon | specific card rank for nrankedcommon (2-14) |
| nstraight | total number of connected cards you have (1-7) |
| nstraightcommon | total number of connected common cards (1-5) |
| nstraightfill | total number of cards needed to fill a straight (0-5) |
| nstraightfillcommon | total number of cards needed to fill a common straight (0-5) |

## History (I)

<div class="rem">

* 1.5*. The action-symbols (didrais, didcall, etc.) mean: what the
autoplayer did, not what the user did or what happened in the hand. That
does regularly confuse new users and causes problem when simulating
hands at ManualMode or with Replay Frames.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| floppct | percentage of players seeing the flop for the last 15 hands |
| turnpct | percentage of players seeing the turn for the last 15 hands |
| riverpct | percentage of players seeing the river for the last 15 hands |

| handsplayed_headsup | number of consecutive hands played headsup, meant for opponent modelling |
| balance_rankx (x=0-9) | ranked list of player balances (includes players not currently in hand, and includes currentbet for each player as well). rank0 has highest balance. |

## Colourcodes

Colourcodes for player-profiling if a casino is not supported by
PokerTracker. Can also be used for easy adaption against regulars and
other friends.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| colourcode0..colourcode9 | The scraped colourcode for playerX, depending on the tablemap region r\$pXcolourcode. All colourcodes will be transformed to the closest web-safe-colour (216 values). This avoids problems with fuzzy casino-displays and 216 values are more easy to be handled by the end-user. |

## Betting Action 

<div class="rem*">

* 1.1*. Betting action symbols depend on game-history, They get updated
once per orbit at our turn and can therefore only used at our turn;
otherwise they are undefined.

</div>

| Symbol | Meaning |

| raisbitsx (x=1-4) | which chairs raised in round x |
| callbitsx (x=1-4) | which chairs called in round x |
| foldbitsx (x=1-4) | which chairs folded in round x |

| ac_preflop_pos | preflop position of the userchair (SB=1 BB=2 Early=3 Middle=4 Late=5 Dealer=6) |
| ac_prefloprais_pos | preflop position of the raiser (SB=1 BB=2 Early=3 Middle=4 Late=5 Dealer=6) |
| ac_postflop_pos | postflop position of the userchair (first=1 early=2 middle=3 late=4 last=5) |
| ac_first_into_pot | returns true if you are first into the pot (first to act or checked to you) |
| ac_betposx (x=0-9) | returns bet position of specified chair |
| ac_dealposx (x=0-9) | returns deal position of specified chair |

## Logging

For example if you have the following f\$raise-formula,

    ##f$raise##
    [ betround == 2 && (nsuited == 3 || nstraight == 3) && log$ItLives ]

and you flop a backdoor flush draw, then OpenHoldem will raise and also
add the text ItLives to the log file, just before the RAIS line.
Everytime a log\$ symbol is accessed it will be flagged for logging. You
can use this to track which part of your formula is to blame for the
action taken by OpenHoldem.

<figure>
<img src="images/openholdem/symbols/log$_symbol.jpg" />
</figure>

<div class="rem*">

* 1.2*. Note: You want to use the log\$ symbol at the end of a logic
block, to make sure it only gets flagged when all the previous
statements are true.

</div>

<div class="rem*">

* 1.3*. As the log\$-symbols modify the autoplayer-trace they require
the autoplayer to be engaged.

</div>

## MessageBoxes with Info

In addition to logging it might be useful to notify the user at run-time
and pause script-execution, mainly in a debugging session. For this
usecase OpenHoldem provides a symbol msgbox\$TEXT, that — surprise —
will show a messagebox with text. As the character-set in symbols is
slightly limited the following replacements will take place.

- \_B will be replaced by a blank

- \_C will be replaced by a comma

- \_D will be replaced by a dot

- \_N will be replaced by a new-line

- \_U will be replaced by a underscore

The symbol msgbox\$TEXT will evaluate to 0. An example:

    ##f$preflop## 
    WHEN Others RETURN (Call + msgbox$WOOHOO_NPreflop_Bworks_D) FORCE

## ICM calculator

An overview of basic ICM push/fold decisions and how they work with
OpenHoldem can be found here:
<http://www.maxinmontreal.com/wiki/index.php5?title=ICM>.

<div class="rem">

* 1.6*. UTG in a symbols name does always mean the first player after BB
at a full-ring table with 10 players. If less players do actually sit at
the table, the first position (UTG) will be ignored and the first player
will be named UTG+1 (or UTG+2, etc.).

</div>

<div class="rem*">

* 1.4*. The ICM symbols will always assume, that you win against the
player with the smallest stack or lose against the player with the
biggest stack of the remaining non-folded players (or against N players
with the N smallest stacks), so the ICM-symbols will be slightly too
pessimistic in multiway-situations. For headsup (including blind-battle)
and against concrete players (e.g. icm_alliwinUTG ) the symbols are
accurate.

## Hand multiplexor

The purpose of the hand multiplexor is to transfer control to a specific
named formula based on your actual 2 card hand. Note that the X’s and
x’s are not case sensitive.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| f\$\$X | Evaluate the UDF that corresponds to my first card |
| f\$\$XX | Evaluate the UDF that corresponds to my first card and second card |
| f\$\$XXx | Evaluate the UDF that corresponds to my first card, second card and suited/unsuited state |

The X’s in the three symbols will be substituted with your actual hand
values at time of evaluation. The first X will contain the the rank of
your highest hole card, the second X will contain the rank of your
lowest hole card, and the third x will contain either a s or o depending
if your hole cards have the same suit or not. The \$\$ will be replaced
with a single dollar sign. For example, if my hole cards are AhKh, then
f\$\$X will result in f\$A upon evaluation. Similarly, f\$\$XX would
result in f\$AK and f\$\$XXx would result in f\$AKs.

OpenHoldem will then evaluate the corresponding user defined function
and return that value for the hand multiplexor symbol. If there is not a
corresponding UDF defined for a given set of hole cards, then the return
result is zero, not an error. The values returned by the hand specific
UDFs are entirely defined by you; one simple suggestion is to have them
return 1 for call and 2 for raise; if you do this then your raise
formula can do this:

    || [ f$$XXx >= 2 ] //hand specific formula calc

## Memory Symbols 

The purpose of these symbols is to provide storage for values in order
to reuse them at some later time. They once got invented as a substitute
for left-hand-side-expressions (assignments of variables), that did not
exist in the WinHoldem-scripting-language, but in reality, this is a bit
a kludge???. A much better choice for LHS expressions is Perl or via the
user-DLL extension. Please see the {Memory Symbols} section for more
information.

## Hand Symbols 

You can reference your dealt hand (hole cards) directly by using the \$
symbols. The general form of the \$ hand symbols are: \$RRs. The \$
character is required, followed by 1 or 2 standard card rank characters.
The hand symbols are not case sensitive. A,K,Q,J,T,9-2 or by X or x
which is a wild card that will match any rank. This is followed by an
optional suit indicator: s - suited, o - offsuit. If the suit indicator
is omitted then suit does not matter.

Examples:

| Symbol | Meaning                                   |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------|
| \$AA   | true if you were dealt aces               |
| \$JT   | true if you were dealt jack ten           |
| \$AKs  | true if you were dealt ace king suited    |
| \$49o  | true if you were dealt four nine offsuit  |
| \$QXs  | true if you were dealt queen any suited   |
| \$J    | true if you were dealt any jack           |
| \$XXs  | true if you were dealt any suited hand    |
| \$XXo  | true if you were dealt any offsuited hand |
| \$q2   | true if you were dealt queen two          |

## Card Symbols 

The actual card value or rank/suit value for both your hand and the
board can be referenced using card symbols. The general form of the \$\$
card symbols are: \$\$AB#. The card symbols are not case sensitive. \$\$
is required. A - is p for player, c for common B - is c for card, r for
rank, s for suit \# - is the card number (player 0-1 for Holdem and 0-3
for Omaha, common 0-4)

Examples

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| \$\$pc0 | the card value for player card zero (1st dealt card) |
| \$\$pr3 | the rank value of player card three (4th dealt card, Omaha) |
| \$\$ps0 | the suit value for player card zero (1st dealt card) |
| \$\$cc0 | the card value of common card zero (1st common card dealt) |
| \$\$cr1 | the rank value of common card oneo (2nd common card dealt) |
| \$\$cs4 | the suit value of common card four (5th common card dealt - river) |

## Card Values 

The rank values are 2..14 for 2..ace (high), the suit values are 0..3
(indentical to the values of the poker-eval-library) and -1 for
undefined. Again the representations of cards are the same as the ones
used by the internally used by the poker-eval-library, plus 253..255 for
cardback / no-card / undefined.

### Ranks

| \#    | CardRank                                             |
|:------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| 14    | Ace                                                  |
| 13    | King                                                 |
| 12    | Queen                                                |
| 11    | Jack                                                 |
| 10..2 | Ten..Two                                             |
| 1     | Ace low (used in rankbits of wheels and wheel-draws) |
| -1    | Undefined (no card or cardback)                      |

### Suits

| Cardsuit                        | Value |
|:--------------------------------|:------|
| Undefined (no card or cardback) | -1    |
| Clubs                           | 2     |
| Diamonds                        | 1     |
| Hearts                          | 0     |
| Spades                          | 3     |
