From left to right, the fields on the Status Bar are:

- Action taken

- Your hole cards

- The board cards

- Your made poker hand

- Handrank of your hole-cards at a level from 1 to 169 where 1 (AA) is
  best and 169 is worst against the number of opponents you have

- PrWin, PrTie and PrLos (the values mean: winning-percentages \* 10)

- Current value of f\$number_of_opponents_for_prwin, one of the standard
  formula functions. This formula is intended to specify the number of
  opponents used for the prwin-calculations; however this number can be
  more or less than the number of opponents actually seen on the table
  at any given time. More information on
  f\$number_of_opponents_for_prwin can be found in the section about
  Primary Functions and in the section about PrWin.

- Number of iterations done and number of iterations to be done
