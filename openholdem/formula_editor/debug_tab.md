# Debug-Tab

A special “function” in the formula-editor is the debug-tab. It supports
the evaluation of symbols, functions and mathematical expressions while
being connected to a table, be it ManualMode, replay-frames or a life
table. Using it is quite simple: one expression per line, each one after
an equality-sign.

After you have entered the expressions you are interested in just click
*Calc* or *Auto* and OpenHoldem will show you the results of all
evaluations like in the picture below. The debug-tab is one of the most
useful features for developing and debugging your OpenHoldem formula
set.
